# How to configure the application :

Before you can use the app, you must follow these steps so it can work.

## Step 1

Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and get your existing API key from there, if you don't have one than you will have to create it from there.

## Step 2

Go to the index.html file then locate the "Google maps and places library" script and replace the word "YOUR_API_KEY" by your actual API key.

## Step 4

Go to the dom.js file in the js folder and find the other API call in the line 83 then replace the word "YOUR_API_KEY" by your API key again.

## Step 5

Save the files and launch the app.
